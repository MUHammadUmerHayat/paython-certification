    "    Object-oriented programming is one of the most effective approaches to writing software. In object-oriented programming you write classes that represent real-world things and situations, and you create objects based on these\n",
    "classes. When you write a class, you define the general behavior that a whole category of objects can have."

    "    A function is a piece of code that is called by name. It can be passed data to operate on and can optionally return data. All data that is passed to a function is explicitly passed. \n",

    "    4. Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "    1. Class:\n",
    "        In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods). \n",
    "    2. Object:\n",
    "        An object is a component of a program that knows how to perform certain actions and how to interact with other elements of the program. Object is a intance of class.\n",
    "    3. Attribute:\n",
    "        In Object-oriented programming(OOP), classes and objects have attributes. Attributes are data stored inside a Object and represent the state of the Object. In short, attributes store information about the instance (Object).\n",
    "    4. Behavior:\n",
    "        A class's behavior determines how an instance of that class operates."
